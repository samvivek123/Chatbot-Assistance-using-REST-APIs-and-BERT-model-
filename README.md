# Chatbot-Assistance-using-REST-APIs-and-BERT-model
The project involves building a website for the IIT Mandi tech fest using REST APIs, along with a
conversational chatbot that uses the BERT model in the Simple Transformers library to assist users with their queries.
The website is designed with a responsive approach and uses technologies such as Django, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and
jQuery. The database is optimized using indexing, caching and query execution plan analysis and the chatbotâ€™s
conversation history is stored in a structured format in the database using serialization. Queuing theory, buffer
management and threading are implemented to handle incoming chatbot requests and improve response time.
